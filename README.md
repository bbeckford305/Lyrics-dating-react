## Planning Story

To plan my dating app I had to think about one of the things I love the most. When it came down to it, music is one of my strong loves. There is a song it seems for everything you're feeling or going through. It can bring you joy, love, sadness, and so much more. I wanted an app that allows people from all over the world to share their love of music and meet that special person that plays to the same beat. First, we needed the user to be able to signup for the site. This will allow them to be able to create an account and add songs and meet other users. When they meet the other user they want to get to know, they can break the ice by sending them a song. That allows the other user to respond back with a song as well. After both users have sent each other at least one song, the option to start sending personal messages becomes available. The hope of this site is to allow music lovers of common interest to meet and find the perfect person to share the song of their life together.
